<!-- badges: end -->


## üëâ Contents

In this repository, you can find all the material used during the webinar and additional resources


- `Slides` 
- `Biblio` folder: additional resources
-  a Workbook (to print out)
- `Data` folder: data files (.csv and .xslx) used during the webinar
- `R` folder containing qmd files with the code 


## To Do: Software installation

### JDemetra+ graphical user interface (GUI) v 3.3.0

Head over to [this page](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main/releases)

Scroll down the page, download and unzip the file **jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64.zip**, 
if you use Windows, or the zip corresponding to you OS in the list.

To start the application, run the file **nbdemetra64.exe** located in the following subfolder ‚Ä¶\jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64\nbdemetra\bin

### JDemetra+ Cruncher v3.3.0

on [this same page](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main/releases), below

download and unzip the compressed folder **jwsacruncher-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64.zip**, if you use Windows...

### R packages 

#### First, if needed, get Java version higher than 17

Easy: Java 21 is embedded in the GUI file you've just installed: you have it !!

You just need it to link to R via R studio

- Once **jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64.zip** is unzipped, the Java will be in located in C:\Software\jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64\nbdemetra\jdk-21.0.2+13-jre 
(path to be adapted to your computer/server): this location must be declared in R.

- Run this code at the beginning of your programs

Sys.setenv("JAVA_HOME" = ".../jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64/nbdemetra/jdk-21.0.2+13-jre")

or (better)

- declare it ‚Äúpermanently‚Äù is the Renviron file (where environment variables specific to R are stored), following the steps below:

        - in the R console run file.edit("~/.Renviron")

        - in the file that opens add the line :

    JAVA_HOME= "C:/Software/jdemetra-standalone-3.x.y-windows-x86_64/nbdemetra/jdk-21.0.2+13-jre"

        - save the file and restart R

#### Install the required R packages

```r
# from R Universe
install.packages("rjd3toolkit", repos = c("https://rjdverse.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
install.packages("rjd3x13", repos = c("https://rjdverse.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
install.packages("rjd3tramoseats", repos = c("https://rjdverse.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
# from CRAN
install.packages("rjwsacruncher")
```
